# typingGame

Developed a typing game where a single word is displayed each time from a list of words, and the user needs to type that word within a specified time limit. The game offers three different levels for users to choose from, allowing them to set the time limit according to their preference. If the user successfully types the displayed word within the given time, their score increases by 1. However, if they fail to do so within the time limit, the game is over. It's a fun and challenging way to test your typing skills and improve your speed and accuracy.
